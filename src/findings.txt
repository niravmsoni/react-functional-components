97. Project setup
    Prior to React 16.8, there was only class based components,
    We can also manage state in Functional components by using hooks.
    We can write entire application using functional components now
    Created basic structure of WatchOPedia

98. 
    Created basic UI for counter where we created 2 buttons: +1 and -1 and integrated it in index.js

99. UseState
    With functional components, we cannot directly use state(Like we used in class based components)
    We need to import hooks. For this, the hook we're going to use is known as useState().

    Hooks can only be used in FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS.
    Need to import hook by using:
        import {useState} from "react";

    JS Code below:
    const Counter = () => {

    useState();
    useState();

    return (
        <div className="col-12 col-md-2 offset-md-5 border  text-white">
        </div>
    );
};

    With React, the hooks cannot be conditional. Every time a component is rendered, all useState() will be executed in SEQUENTIAL ORDER

    We can initialize whatever value we want the state to have in the useState parameter.
    For ex: In our counter app, since we want it to start always with 0, we will write the statement like this:
        useState(0);

    useState() always returns 2 values as below:
        const [counter, setCounter] = useState(10);
    where
        counter = name of the counter
        &
        setCounter = how we will update that particular state i.e. setCounter is a method that we will create to increment the count
